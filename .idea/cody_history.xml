                      <text value="The code in add.blade.php is a form template for adding or updating vehicle information in a vehicle rental or management system. Here's an explanation of what it does:&#10;&#10;This form allows users to input or edit details about a vehicle. It takes various inputs from the user, including the vehicle's image, drop-off points, vehicle type and class, name, brand, model, and many technical specifications like engine capacity, horsepower, speed, and more. It also collects information about the vehicle's condition, transmission type, fuel type, number of seats, total distance traveled, and rental price.&#10;&#10;The form doesn't produce any direct output itself. Instead, when submitted, it sends all the collected information to a server-side route (user.vehicle.update) where the data will be processed and stored in a database.&#10;&#10;The form achieves its purpose by presenting a series of input fields, dropdown menus, and file upload options to the user. Each field corresponds to a specific piece of information about the vehicle. The form uses HTML form elements along with Laravel Blade templating syntax to structure the inputs and pre-fill existing data when updating a vehicle.&#10;&#10;Some important features of the form include:&#10;&#10;1. Image upload: It allows users to upload a main image for the vehicle and multiple additional images.&#10;2. Dynamic dropdowns: The vehicle type selection affects the available options in the vehicle class dropdown.&#10;3. Use of select2 for enhanced dropdown functionality.&#10;4. Integration with a rich text editor (nicEdit) for the description field.&#10;5. Data validation: It uses required attributes on inputs to ensure necessary information is provided.&#10;6. Old input retention: If form submission fails, it retains previously entered data using Laravel's old() helper.&#10;&#10;The form also includes some conditional logic, like showing different options based on the vehicle type selected, and formatting certain inputs (like price and total run) using helper functions.&#10;&#10;Overall, this form serves as a comprehensive data collection tool for gathering detailed information about vehicles in a rental or management system, allowing for both adding new vehicles and updating existing ones." />

Here's an explanation of what it does:&#10;&#10;This form allows users to input or edit details about a vehicle. It takes various inputs from the user, including the vehicle's image, drop-off points, vehicle type and class, name, brand, model, and many technical specifications like engine capacity (CC), horsepower (BHP), speed, and more. It also collects information about the vehicle's condition, transmission type, fuel type, number of seats, total distance run, and rental price per day.&#10;&#10;The form doesn't produce any direct output itself. Instead, when submitted, it sends all this information to a server-side route (user.vehicle.update) which will process the data and likely save it to a database.&#10;&#10;The form achieves its purpose by presenting a series of input fields, dropdown menus, and file upload options to the user. Each field corresponds to a specific piece of information about the vehicle. The form uses various HTML input types (text, number, select, file) to collect appropriate data formats for each field.&#10;&#10;Some important features of this form include:&#10;&#10;1. Image upload: It allows users to upload a main image for the vehicle and multiple additional images.&#10;&#10;2. Dynamic dropdowns: The vehicle type selection affects the available options in the vehicle class dropdown.&#10;&#10;3. Use of old input values: If the form is being used to edit an existing vehicle, it pre-fills the form fields with the current values.&#10;&#10;4. Multiple selection: For drop-off points, users can select multiple options.&#10;&#10;5. Formatted inputs: Some fields like price and total run use input groups to add units (like currency or KM) to the input.&#10;&#10;6. Rich text editor: For the description field, it uses a rich text editor (nicEdit) to allow formatted text input.&#10;&#10;The form includes client-side validation by marking many fields as required, ensuring that essential information is not omitted. It also provides guidance to users about file types and sizes for image uploads.&#10;&#10;Overall, this form serves as a comprehensive data collection tool for gathering detailed information about vehicles in a rental or management system, allowing for both adding new vehicles and updating existing ones." />
